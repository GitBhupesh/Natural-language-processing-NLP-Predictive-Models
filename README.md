# Spam_Mail_Prediction_Model

## Introduction

The major issues faced by all the email users are spam mails which contain unwanted information and data and some fake data to spoil the life of the people and also some mails which cause harmful effects. To reduce this risk and to save the people from this danger of spam mails, we are building this Gmail Spam Detection Model.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a prediction model to predict whether a mail is spam or not.

## Aim

Aim of this project is the detection of spam email using the dataset and natural language processing. We will also be using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
